Pounce is a simple command line utility that allows you to access 
quick lists from the command line and store key/value pairs in 
different quickly accessible lists. These can be accessed from the 
command line via simple commands (and can also be copied to the 
clipboard).

You can use it to do stuff like:
~ Keep regularly used URLs to which you need quick access.
~ Maintaining a simple to-do list rather than a task manager
~ Mainting text snippets and and any other random pastes, code 
  snippets that ypu may use later.

The program is released under the Terms and Conditions of the GNU 
General Public License Version 3.
